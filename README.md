Author: Aishwarya Munigoti Title: Study Nook Overview of Project: My project is a study website called Study Nook, where users have a cozy environment in which they can study. The website currently has a feature to set a timer, and a log schedule option where users can log their schedule for the day. It also has a quote of the day, the quotes are fetched from Quotes On Design API. The website right now is still elementary, but more features and better UI will be implemented in the future. How to run: To run the project, click on the GitHub repository link.
